select & from student s right join mark m on s.id=m.studentId // all the rows from right table and matching columns from left table will be selected

select \* from student s inner join mark m on s.id=m.studentId //all the matching rows from both will be selected

select studentId,Mark from mark group by StudentId;
select studentId, sum(Mark) from mark group by studentId;

note: where is used to add condition in non grouped data where as having is used to add condition in grouped data

select studentId,Mark from mark group by StudentId having StudentId in(1,4);

select studentId, sum(mark) from mark where subject!="maths" group by studentId having studentId in(1,4);
